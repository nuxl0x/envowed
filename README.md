# Envowed
Some actions are reprehensible. Unforgivable, even.  
  
**Envowed** allows you to punish other players for their transgressions without needing intervention from a moderator, or otherwise.  
Using this mod, you are able to obtain powerful weaponry and artifacts that can, at their strongest, ban players from servers.
